\section*{Reflection}

\subsection*{What went well}
I feel overall I had a solid grasp the concepts that go into building a compiler through the project. I feel that there were a few solutions I came up with that were quite elegant and worked really well, such as the Code class and the ValueCode class. 

\subsection*{What did not go well}
There were some design decision that I made in this project that turned out to cause a lot of problems later on. The first was my decision to fully object orientate my AST. While that did occasionally allow for some very elegant code, it also forced a lot of code duplication and created ugly code in places where I had to handle irregularities in the AST. I also feel that it was a design blunder to use strings for all the variables and values in the IR, since it forced me to do a lot of repeated string manipulations. 

\subsection*{Advice}
I feel some of the biggest design flaws in my project stem from my desire to do things my own way rather than just following what Professor Nguyen gave in the starter code. However, I feel I learned more because of that. I would advise that using the starter code will make your work easier, but it may not learn as much. Other than that you will likely benefit a lot if you read the textbook and try to start working on things early.
