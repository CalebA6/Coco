Design Check List
\begin{todolist}
    \item Only errors and warnings related to user programs are shown in stdout/stderr. Internal errors and debug information must be hidden.
    \item No reliance on JVM's assertion: i.e., no "-ea"
    \item Use JDK no newer than JDK17(LTS) 
    \item \texttt{main() is void} - should not return any expression.
    \item All syntactic errors are shown. Must not stop after one parsing error.
    \item All semantic errors are shown. Must not stop after one semantic error.
    \item No hard-coded optimization order.
    \item An additional pass after register allocation to remove silly MOVE
    % \item Dot graph files end with ".dot"
    \item A mode where Dot graphs are overwritten so that I can see the graph on-the-fly
    \item Dot graph before and after each optimization, in order.
    \item Dot graph files separated by input program.
    % \item Auto-optimization pass
    % \item Optimization sequence is treated as seed sequence. The whole optimization pass must run till fixed-point.
    \item Print all code modifications (easier to grade by counting?)
\end{todolist}
